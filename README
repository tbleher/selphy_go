This is a forked version of Wilmer van der Gaast's selphy_go.

See the original README (README.ORIG) and this blog post for more details:

  https://wilmer.gaa.st/blog/archives/76-selphy.go-Linux-client-for-Canon-Selphy-CP-900-photo-printer.html

I hope this repo is short-lived, I intend push all changes to Wilmer, 
and possibly rewrite it in pure C and merge that into my selphy_print 
backend suite.

    * Ribbon depleted
    * Paper depleted
    * Other errors?
